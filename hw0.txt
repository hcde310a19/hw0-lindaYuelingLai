# Description of your program (part 7)
How to count the number of words in a document:
1. Open/get access to the document
2. Start counting from 0 (i.e. count=0)
3. Read all the words one by one, and every time we read a word (i.e. characters separated by a space),
add 1 to the current count (count=count+1)
4. Keep counting till the last word of the document, then the count is the number of words in the document

# Reflection on writing your program (part 8)
At first I felt this exercise was a little bit hard since I have not done programming or something like this
for a while. But after I tried breaking down the problem into steps, it became easier and I was able to be more
precise as well.

In HCDE 310, I wish to learn Python and be more familiar with APIs. And as a designer, I also wish to learn how
to use the programming skills we learned for design work.
